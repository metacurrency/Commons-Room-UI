This project implements a JavaScript, browser-hosted user interface for the commons-room receptor complex that serves as a test-bed for the [ceptr platform](https://github.com/zippy/anansi).  Please see the [low-level documentation](https://github.com/zippy/anansi/blob/master/README-commons-room.markdown) on the commons-room, for a list of all the signals a commons-room receptor receives.
